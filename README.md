# PFHTML
PolyFormHTML, or PFHTML, is a tool to transpile documents from file formats such as `.ini`, `.json`, and/or `.md` to `.html` and/or `.css`.

You must specify all CSS imports and whatnot in the `.ini` file.

`.json` files are used for CSS styling.

`.md` files are used for the main HTML body (what is shown).

# PseudoMD
PseudoMD (Pseudo-MarkDown), is a file format `.pmd` that is designed to replace `.md` in this project.

It will be a better, more-flexible, and foolproof format.
